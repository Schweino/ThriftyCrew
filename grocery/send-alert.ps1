  send-alert.ps1 - Emails a grocery-pipeline failure alert to Brad (schweino68@gmail.com) via the Gmail API,
  reusing the Work Google OAuth token. Only call this on a HARD failure (a pull that failed AFTER a retry),
  never on a temporary hiccup like "a store's new ad isn't posted yet."

  Requires the shared Google token to include the gmail.send scope. If it doesn't yet, this logs the failure
  and exits 1 (so the caller can fall back) - run google-oauth-authorize.ps1 once to add the scope.

  Usage: powershell -File send-alert.ps1 -Subject "Grocery pull failed: Baker's" -Body "details..."

  # bypass the once-per-type-per-day gate for a genuinely new incident that must page through today. Callers

# ---- ONE EMAIL PER ALERT TYPE PER DAY -------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2026-07-23: a single bad Walmart pull produced ~20 emails in one morning - not because 20 things broke, but
# because the pipeline ran 3 times and each run re-fired every alert channel (guards-failed, coverage-held,
# stores-dropped, drift, ...). The failures were real and the fail-closed design was correct; the INBOX was
# the bug. So the alert TYPE (the subject with its date/counts/rc-codes stripped) may email at most once a day.
# A stable, ongoing condition alerts once and then stays quiet until it either clears or a new day starts.
